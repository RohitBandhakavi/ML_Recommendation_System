# Content Based Recommendation System
An end to end data Movie recommendation Project

📚 Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python and machine learning techniques. It leverages natural language processing and similarity measures to recommend movies based on user input.

🔍 Key Features
Built using Python, scikit-learn, and Pandas

Extracts and processes metadata (genre, cast, director, etc.) from movie datasets

Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend movies

Provides a simple and interactive Flask-based web interface for real-time recommendations

Designed for educational and demonstrative purposes for understanding recommendation systems

📁 Files Included
ML_Recommendation.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering and TF-IDF vectorization

Cosine similarity implementation

Evaluation of the recommendation logic

App.py – A lightweight Flask application that:

Serves a front-end form for entering a movie title

Displays top similar movies based on content similarity

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Flask)

Jupyter Notebook

TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

Cosine Similarity
